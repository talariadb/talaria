This repository contains a fork of TalariaDB, a distributed, highly available, and low latency time-series database for Big Data systems. It was originally [designed and implemented in Grab](https://engineering.grab.com/big-data-real-time-presto-talariadb), where millions and millions of transactions and connections take place every day , which requires a platform scalable data-driven decision making.

## Introduction

TalariaDB helped us to overcome the challenge of retrieving and acting upon the information from large amounts of data. It addressed our need to query at least 2-3 terabytes of data per hour with predictable low query latency and low cost. Most importantly, it plays very nicely with the different toolsâ€™ ecosystems and lets us query data using SQL.


From the original design, we have extended Talaria to be setup in a two possible ways:

 1. As an **event ingestion platform**. This allows you to track events using a simple gRPC endpoint from almost anywhere.
 2. As a **data store for hot data**. This allows you to query hot data (e.g. last 6 hours) as it goes through the data pipeline and ultimately ends up in your data lake when compacted.

Talaria is designed around event-based data model. An event is essentially a set of key-value pairs, however to make it consistent we need to define a set of commonly used keys.
Each event will consist of the following:

* Hash key (e.g: using "event" key). This represents the type of the event and could be prefixed with the source scope (eg. "table1") and using the dot as a logical separator. The separation and namespacing is not required, but strongly recommended to make your system more usable.
* Sort key (e.g: using "time" key). This represents the time at which the update has occurred, in unix timestamp (as precise as the source allows) and encoded as a 64-bit integer value.
* Other key-value pairs will represent various values of the columns.

Below is an example of what a payload for an event describing a table update might look like.

| KEY         | VALUE               | DATA TYPE   |
|-------------|---------------------|-------------|
| **event**   | table1.update       | `string`    |
| **time**    | 1586500157          | `int64`     |
| **column1** | hello               | `string`    |
| **column2** | { "name": "roman" } | `json`      |

Talaria sypports `string`, `int32`, `int64`, `bool`, `float64`, `timestamp` and `json` data types which are used to construct columns that can be exposed to Presto/SQL.

## Event Ingestion with Talaria

If your organisation needs a reliable and scalable data ingestion platform, you can set up Talaria as one. The main advantage is that such platform is cost-efficient, does not require a complex Kafka setup and even offers in-flight query if you also point a Presto on it. The basic setup allows you to track events using a simple gRPC endpoint from almost anywhere.

In order to setup Talaria as an ingestion platform, you will need specify a table, in this case "eventlog", and enable `compaction` in the configuration, something along these lines:

```yaml
mode: staging
env: staging
domain: "talaria-headless.default.svc.cluster.local"
storage:
  dir: "/data"
tables:
  eventlog:
    compact:                               # enable compaction
      interval: 60                         # compact every 60 seconds
      nameFunc: "s3://bucket/namefunc.lua" # file name function
      s3:                                  # sink to Amazon S3
        region: "ap-southeast-1"
        bucket: "bucket"
...
```

Once this is set up, you can point a gRPC client (see [protobuf definition](proto/talaria.proto)) directly to the ingestion endpoint. Note that we also offer some pre-generated or pre-made ingestion clients [in this repository](/client/).

```
service Ingress {
  rpc Ingest(IngestRequest) returns (IngestResponse) {}
}
```

Below is a list of currently supported sinks and their example configurations:

- [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) using [s3 sink](./internal/storage/writer/s3).
- [DigitalOcean Spaces](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/spaces/) using [s3 sink](./internal/storage/writer/s3), a custom endpoint and us-east-1 region.
- [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage/) using [gcs sink](./internal/storage/writer/gcs).
- Local filesystem using [file sink](./internal/storage/writer/file).
- [Microsoft Azure Blob Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/storage/blobs/) using [azure sink](./internal/storage/writer/azure).
- [Minio](https://min.io/) using [s3 sink](./internal/storage/writer/s3), a custom endpoint and us-east-1 region.
- [Google Big Query](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/) using [bigquery sink](./internal/storage/writer/bigquery).
- Talaria itself using [talaria sink](./internal/storage/writer/talaria).

For Microsoft Azure Blob Storage and Azure Data Lake Gen 2, we support writing across multiple storage accounts.
We supports two modes:

1. Random choice, where each write is directed to a storage account randomly, for which you can just specficy a list of storage accouts.
2. Weighted choice, where a set of weights (positive integers) are assigned and each write is directed to a storage account based on the specified weights.

An example of weighted choice is shown below:

```yaml
    - azure:
        container: a_container
        prefix: a_prefix
        blobServiceURL: .storage.microsoft.net
        storageAccounts:
            - a_storage_account
            - b_storage_account
        storageAccountWeights: [1, 2]
```

Random choice and weighed choice are particularly useful for some key scenarios:

- High throughput deployment where the I/O generate by Talaria exceedes the limitation of the stroage accounts.
- When deploying on internal endpoints with multiple VPNs links and you want to split the network traffic across multiple
  network links.

## Hot Data Query with Talaria

If your organisation requires querying of either hot data (e.g. last n hours) or in-flight data (i.e as ingested), you can also configure Talaria to serve it to Presto using built-in [Presto Thrift](https://prestodb.io/docs/current/connector/thrift.html) connector.

![alt text](.github/images/query.png)

In the example configuration below we're setting up an `s3 + sqs` writer to continously ingest files from an S3 bucket and an "eventlog" table which will be exposed to Presto.

```yaml
mode: staging
env: staging
domain: "talaria-headless.default.svc.cluster.local"
writers:
  grpc:
    port: 8080
  s3sqs:
    region: "ap-southeast-1"
    queue: "queue-url"
    waitTimeout: 1
    retries: 5
readers:
  presto:
    schema: data
    port: 8042
storage:
  dir: "/data"
tables:
  eventlog:
    ttl: 3600         # data is persisted for 1 hour
    hashBy: event
    sortBy: time
...
```

Once you have set up Talaria, you'll need to configure Presto to talk to it using the [Thrift Connector](https://prestodb.io/docs/current/connector/thrift.html). You would need to make sure that:
 1. In the properties file you have configured to talk to Talaria through a kubernetes load balancer.
 2. Presto can access directly the nodes, without the load balancer.

Once this is done, you should be able to query your data via Presto.

```sql
select *
from talaria.data.eventlog
where event = 'table1.update'
limit 1000
```

## Ingesting Files Into Talaria

To ingest existing ORC, CSV or Parquet files from a storage URL (imagine S3 or Azure Blob Storage), use the Talaria File Ingestion Client:

## Quick Start

The easiest way to get started would be using the provided [helm chart](https://github.com/crphang/charts/tree/master/talaria).
